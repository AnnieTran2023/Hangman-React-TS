   - Once a letter is guessed, it will be disabled to prevent guessing the same letter again.
   - If you guess all the letters in the word correctly within 6 attempts, you win!
   - If you run out of attempts without guessing the word, you lose.

3. **End of Game**:
   - If you win, congratulations! You guessed the word correctly.
   - If you lose, don't worry! The correct word will be revealed, and the missing letters will be shown in red.
   - Refresh the page to play again.
